      "Message: She always helps me with my homework, and I'm really thankful for her assistance. Reasoning: This sentence matches the B1 level of English proficiency because it demonstrates an ability to express gratitude and describe a recurring action. It includes a simple present tense (\"She always helps me with my homework\") to convey a habitual action and uses vocabulary like \"thankful\" and \"assistance\" to express feelings and convey ideas clearly.

To do integration, we use an antiderivative or the integral symbol (\u222b). The integral of a function gives us a new function called the antiderivative or indefinite integral. This new function represents the overall effect of the original function.\n\nFor example, let's look at the function f(x) = 2x. To find its indefinite integral, we use the power rule of integration, which says that the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1). Using this rule, we integrate f(x) like this:\n\n\u222b 2x dx = x^2 + C\n\nHere, the constant of integration, C, accounts for any potential change in the initial function's value.\n\nI hope this explanation has helped you understand the concept of integration.

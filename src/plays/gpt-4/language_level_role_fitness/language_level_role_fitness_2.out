The interest rate for a savings account is set by our bank's policy and broader economic factors. This rate is usually reviewed yearly, though it can change more often based on market conditions.

This could be taking cash out at an ATM, transferring money online, or setting up direct debits. The rules for these transactions can differ based on the type of savings account you have. For example, some accounts may limit the number of free withdrawals per month, while others might charge for every withdrawal. I trust this helps.

As we delve further into the era of digital technology, artificial intelligence plays an increasingly pivotal role, particularly in areas of privacy and security.

Conversely, there is a valid apprehension that as artificial intelligence becomes more intricate, it could potentially misuse personal data, thereby sparking privacy concerns.

Nevertheless, it's in these scenarios where international collaboration and multi-stakeholder strategies can have a significant impact. Global organizations, technology firms, and civil society need to work together to set universal norms and standards. This could include exchanging successful strategies, offering technical support, and championing capacity-building initiatives.

Secondly, the transparency of AI algorithms is of utmost importance. By rendering AI system decision-making processes more comprehensible, we are enabled to more effectively scrutinize them for any potential bias.
